# Exercises from Eloquent JavaScript

I picked up this book because I believe in the concept of _Beginnerâ€™s mind_. So far I applied this idea when working though [How To Design Programs](https://github.com/jakub-c/exercises-how-to-design-programs) and [The Little Schemer](https://github.com/jakub-c/exercises-the-little-schemer) books.

I chose this book because I've been coding JavaScript since I remember; I was curious if I would learn anything if I tried to re-learn the language from scratch.

Because I knew JS already I didn't find any groundbreaking material here. Working through the book felt like a hike through a really well prepared trail. I enjoyed the journey and learned few small things on the way. For example I never really thought about the implementation of original nodeJS module system, so it was quite interesting to implement similar functionality.

## General remarks

I still need to get through part 2 (browser and DOM)
